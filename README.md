# Quick Project For Tracking How Well You Do On a Practice Test

While studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam, I had a print out of a practice test and I wanted to see how well I was actually doing so I whipped this up given I couldn't find anything online like it.

It could probably be better idk, but I through webgl in there cause why not.
